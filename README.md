# PokemonTypeChart
A Pokemon Type Chart that I have created that is an executable made in python that manipulates an excel sheet and will ask you how many pokemon you have in your team, what those pokemon are, and if you want to see the strengths and weaknesses of your team.

In order to use this properly, you will have to spell the pokemon types correctly, if you don't know how to spell the types, just start the exe and type No when it asks if you want to see the advantages and weaknesses. It will just give you the current type chart and you are then able to see how everything is spelled.
Make sure if you use the exe, that you close the excel sheet since it can't modify the sheet if the excel sheet is open.

If you do not have microsoft excel, you can still import the excel sheet to a google sheet by opening a new google sheet, clicking file, then click import, it will open a box that has an upload section and then you want to find where you have the excel sheet at and drag it onto the box.
